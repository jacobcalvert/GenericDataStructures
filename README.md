This is a collection of generic templated data structures. The reason? Just because. 


Structures Done
====================
* Queue
* Stack
* List
* MinHeap

Structures Planned
====================
* MaxHeap
* Red-Black Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* ....???



The planned list will probably grow as I see more interesting things I want to add to it. 


KNOWN BUGS
===============
* in the heap structure, I have not tested if it is reusable as far as multipt insert and remove mins interleaved
* I'm converting the char* in the exception generation code to std::string so the compiler will shut up with deprecation warnings
* I'm sure I will find more!
