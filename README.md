This is a collection of generic templated data structures. The reason? Just because. 
I am attempting to go back and doxygen-style comment the code as well as document it here.


Structures Done
--------------------
* Queue
* Stack
* List
* MinHeap
* Binary Search Tree

Structures Planned
-----------------------
* MaxHeap
* Red-Black Tree
* ....???



The planned list will probably grow as I see more interesting things I want to add to it. 


KNOWN BUGS / ISSUES
-----------------------
* in the heap structure, I have not tested if it is reusable as far as multipt insert and remove mins interleaved
* remove() is not implemented for the BST nor is height();
* I'm sure I will find more!

CLOSED BUGS / ISSUES
------------------------
* I'm converting the char* in the exception generation code to std::string so the compiler will shut up with deprecation warnings [closed 10/15/2014]


Structures and Features
============================

Queue
--------
### Features ###
* finite and infinte sizes that are enforced in the object, set via the constructor
* exceptioned for unsupported operations (dequeue when empty etc.)
### Supported Methods ###

Method Name | Description
-----------------------------------
empty()	| empties the queue
enqueue(data)| enqueues(data) into the queue
dequeue()| dequeues an item
is_empty()| is it empty?
is_full()| is it full? (only valid with finite queues)
== & !=	| performs a node-by-node comparison of the two queues

Stack
-------------
### Features
* finite and infinte sizes that are enforced in the object, set via the constructor
* exceptioned for unsupported operations (pop when empty etc.)
### Supported Methods

Method Name 	| Description
-----------------------------------
pop()		| removes and returns the top of the stack
push(data)	| pushes(data) onto the top of the stack
peek()		| look at the top item
is_empty()	| is it empty?
is_full()	| is it full? (only valid with finite stacks)
== & !=		| performs a node-by-node comparison of the two stacks
